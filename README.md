# SpotifyCPP-ESP

## The esp branch!

[![PlatformIO Registry](https://badges.registry.platformio.org/packages/harryskerritt/library/SpotifyCPP-esp.svg)](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/harryskerritt/SpotifyCPP-esp)

A modern, high-performance **C++ library for the Spotify Web API**. Designed to be lightweight and intuitive, this library provides comprehensive access to Spotify's ecosystem—from catalog metadata to real-time player controls.

Built for developers who want a "no-nonsense" interface to Spotify without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

*This project is **not** affiliated with Spotify AB*

---

## Features

- **Full Catalog Access**: Deep integration for Albums, Tracks, Artists, Shows, and Episodes.
- **Smart Player Controls**: Real-time interaction with the Spotify Player (Transfer playback, seek, shuffle, repeat, and volume).
- **Automated Auth**: Handles the OAuth2 **Authorization Code Flow** with a built-in local server to capture redirect codes.
- **Robust Models**: Statically typed C++ objects for all API responses—no more searching through raw JSON strings.
- **Paging Support**: Simple iterator-like access for large datasets (Top Tracks, Playlists, Search results).
- **Error Handling**: Granular exception system including `APIException`, `NetworkException`, and `RateLimitException`.

## Current Version: v0.9.5
Added the Average and Vibrant colours

### What will be in v1.0.0
- Documentation needs finalising
- Some data types need fully implementing
- Final tests

---

## Built With

- **[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)** - The "JSON for Modern C++" library. We use this for all JSON parsing and serialization. Its intuitive syntax allowed us to keep the library codebase clean and maintainable.
  - *Credit to Niels Lohmann and contributors for this incredible piece of software.*
- **[yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)** - Used for the internal `AuthServer` to handle OAuth callbacks.
- **[libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/)** - Powers the underlying HTTP network layer.

## Installation

### Requirements
- A C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 19.29+)
- `libcurl` installed on your system.
- `CMake` 3.15 or higher.

### Including in project

SpotifyCPP library provides the following header files that can be included in your project:

`spotify.hpp`

```c++
#include <spotify/spotify.hpp>
```

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harry-Skerritt/SpotifyAPILib.git
cd SpotifyAPILib
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### CMake FetchContent
Include in CMakeLists.txt
```text

```


### Platform.IO

1. Open `platformio.ini`,  a project configuration file located in the root of PlatformIO project.
2. Add the following line to the `lib_deps` option of `[env:]` section:

```bash
  harryskerritt/SpotifyCPP@^0.9.2
```

3. Build a project, PlatformIO will automatically install dependencies.

### PlatformIO Core CLI

1. Open PlatformIO Core CLI
2. Change directory (cd) to the PlatformIO project where platformio.ini is located.
3. Copy the following pio pkg install command and paste into the CLI shell, press Enter:
```bash
    pio pkg install --library "harryskerritt/SpotifyCPP@^0.9.2"
```

## Quick Start

A more in depth authentication example can be found [here](/docs/Tutorials/Authentication.md).

### 1. Simple Authentication

Using the built-in `AuthServer` to grab a token in seconds:

```c++
#include <spotify/spotify.hpp>

int main() {
    // 1. Setup credentials
    Spotify::Auth auth({ "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" });

    // 2. Generate Auth URL & open browser
    auto url = auth.createAuthoriseURL("[http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback](http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback)", { 
        Spotify::Scope::UserReadPlaybackState, 
        Spotify::Scope::UserModifyPlaybackState 
    });
    Spotify::AuthServer::openBrowser(url);

    // 3. Listen for the redirect code
    std::string code = Spotify::AuthServer::waitForCode("127.0.0.1", 8888);
    auth.exchangeCode(code);

    // 4. Start making calls!
    Spotify::Client client(auth);
    auto user = client.users().getCurrentUserProfile();
    std::cout << "Logged in as: " << user.display_name << std::endl;
}
```

### 2. Fetching Data

```c++
// Get an album by ID
auto album = client.album().getAlbum("4aawyAB9vmq7uQrQ7Yp7M4");
std::cout << "Album: " << album.name << " (" << album.release_date << ")" << std::endl;

// List tracks in the album
for (const auto& track : album.tracks.items) {
    std::cout << " - " << track.track_number << ". " << track.name << std::endl;
}
```
